Please note this is currently alpha-level quality software. Use at your own risk.

Features
--------

Current records scores, timeouts and provides preset timers. The top button is used to log a score,
the bottom button controls the timer and the middle button opens the main menu.

The timer is stopped and started by pressing the bottom button. Holding the bottom button allows the
timer to be reset. If the 25 second "play clock" is being used, it will automatically reset when started.

TODO:
-----

* More control over lengths of periods
* Undo of score/timeouts
* Layout improvements

In the future I would like to be able to network multiple pebbles together so that all officials in a game
have access to the current state of the game (score/clock/timeouts).
